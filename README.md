# OpenCommerce SDK

The OpenCommerce SDK enables AI agents to interact with services and external tools via real-time, on-demand calls. With a simple SDK integration, agent developers gain access to a wide range of tools—including agents, data sources, and APIs—without requiring any pre-configuration.

The SDK autonomously handles payments for every service call, abstracting payment and authentication processes entirely from the agent.

## Features

- **Instant Start**: Begin without complex setup or preconfiguration.
- **Ready-Made Agents**: Access essential, pre-built agents on demand.
- **Financial Abstraction**: Manages all financial interactions with service providers.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily works with agent frameworks like LangChain.
- **Streamlined Funding**: Simplified options for agent funding.

## Installation

```bash
pip install opencommerce-sdk

## Quick Start

from opencommerce_sdk import OpenCommerceAccountToolkit

# Initialize the OpenCommerce Account Toolkit
